Porkchop is an attempt to create a language with the following properties:

* Strong, dynamic typing
* Minimal syntax
* Everything is either a closure or an array of closures
* Lazy evaluation by default
* Functions are curried automatically
* A powerful, elegant object system with nice syntax built entirely on top of the language as a library


== Typing

Right now Porkchop uses Ruby's type system.

== Syntax

The language defines syntax for the following concepts:

= Core syntax:

* Closures:  {} and (arg1, arg2) {}
* Lists:  []

= Shortcut syntax:

* Variable Assignment:

  x: y
  # shortcut for:
  set 'x', y

* "Peeking":
  
  x.y
  # short for:
  peek 'y', x
  
Everything else is accomplished with function calls.
